## Using Branch and Bound Algorithm 

# Branch and Bound: 

The search for an answer node can often be speeded by using an “intelligent” ranking function, also called an approximate cost function to avoid searching in sub-trees that do not contain an answer node. It is similar to the backtracking technique but uses a BFS-like search. 

There are basically three types of nodes involved in Branch and Bound 

1. Live node is a node that has been generated but whose children have not yet been generated. 

2. E-node is a live node whose children are currently being explored. In other words, an E-node is a node currently being expanded. 

3. Dead node is a generated node that is not to be expanded or explored any further. All children of a dead node have already been expanded. 


# Problem statement: 

This program is a game in which numbers are spread randomly and the player is supposed to arrange them in order with the given keys. 

 
# Problem Explanation: 

In this problem there are 15 tiles, which are numbered from 0 – 15. 

The objective of this problem is to transform the arrangement of tiles from initial arrangement to a goal arrangement. 

The initial and goal arrangement is shown by the following figure. 

# Steps / Algorithm to solve the problem: 

Move the empty space in the grid in order from 1 to 15 where A=10 to F=15 

To move the tile you can use your keywords on the keyboard.  

F or f - up, 

A or a- Down, 

C or c- Left, 

E or e - Right 

If any other character is used, then it shows a dialogue of the Wrong character being used. 

In the puzzle above A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F is 15.

# Cost function: 

Each node X in the search tree is associated with a cost. The cost function is useful for determining the next E-node. The next E-node is the one with the least cost. The cost function is defined as 

C(X) = g(X) + h(X) where 

   g(X) = cost of reaching the current node  

          from the root 

   h(X) = cost of reaching an answer node from X. 

 

In the above program, heuristics for all tiles on the board are as follows.

# Time Complexity:  

O(n^n) is definitely an upper bound on solving n-puzzle using backtracking when you are solving this by assigning an empty tile column-wise. However, consider this - when we assign a location of the empty tile in the first column, you have n options, after that, you only have n-1 options.  

 

If we add all this up and define the run time as T(N). Then T(N) = O(N2) + N*T(N-1). If you draw a recursion tree using this recurrence, the final term will be something like n3+ n!O(1). By the definition of Big O, this can be reduced to O(n!) running time.  

Thus, the worst-case complexity is still upper bounded by O(n!).
